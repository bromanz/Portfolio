# Performance Evaluation of Acceleration Structures for Cone Tracing Traversal
## Summary
This paper focuses on the technical question of how to apply acceleration structures used for polygonal scenes from ray to cone tracing. We examine cone traversal performance for k-d trees and bounding volume hierarchies. Our results demonstrate which accelerator to prefer for cone tracing given corresponding apertures, and provide an estimation when cones of varying sizes could replace a specified number of ray samples with the same traversal performance but without subsampling.

## Achievements
* Paper to appear in Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (JCGT)
* Created a GPU ray- and cone tracing framework in Unity3D in a team of two.
* Building of kd-tree and SBVH (Stich et al.) in Unity3D on the CPU from scratch.
* Implemented various traversal algorithms for rays and cones on the GPU from scratch.

## My responsibilities
* This was my master thesis, so basically everything.
